Hi! This is **Aryan Singh**, the owner of this repository. This is a project made by me for the Inspire awards. The project is of a quadruped robot which is specialized for locating victims of a fire. 

- The file named *ardu.ino* is the code of the Arduino Nano used for data collection and servo control.
- The file named *esp.ino* is the code of the esp32 for communication between controller and the robot.
- The file named *control.ino* is the code of the remote control which uses a joystick for manouvering && an oled screen for showing the data collected by numerous sensors of the robot.

**The code is under development so there is still much to be done like improving functions, improving compatibility, etc.**
