Hi! This is **Aryan Singh**, the owner of this repository. This is a project made by me for the Inspire awards. The project is of a quadruped robot which is specialized for locating victims of a fire. 

- The file named *quadruped.ino* is the code of the robot, which integrates an Arduino Nano && an ESP32 microcontroller.
- The file named *control.ino* is the code of the remote control which uses a joystick for manouvering && an oled screen for showing the data collected by numerous sensors of the robot.
